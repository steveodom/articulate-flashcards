I wanted to experiment with the new state management package, [Unstated](https://github.com/jamiebuilds/unstated) as an alternative to Redux. (I enjoyed it for this simple example, BTW) 

## Install:
npm install || yarn install

## Tests:
npm test || yarn test

## Start:
npm run start || yarn start
